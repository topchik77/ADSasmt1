This repository contains solutions to algorithm and data structure problems implemented in Java. Each problem is solved using functions and recursion, and the solutions are organized into separate classes for each task in the package called tasks.

Task1: Find the minimum element in an array.

Task2: Calculate the average of elements in an array.

Task3: Check if a given number is prime.

Task4: Find the factorial of a number using recursion.

Task5: Find the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

Task6: Calculate the power of a number.

Task7: Reverse an array without using an extra array (using recursion).

Task8: Check if a string consists only of digits.

Task9: Calculate the binomial coefficient (Cn,k) using recursion.

Task10: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.
